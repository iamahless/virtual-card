# Buzzvel Assessment - QR Code Generator
This project is a solution to João's problem of carrying business cards. The goal is to create a simple tool that generates a QR code for João's business card, which when scanned, redirects to a webpage containing his business details.

### How it Works
The project consists of two main parts:
 - A webpage that generates a unique QR code for a user business card. The QR code will contain a URL that points to his business details webpage.
 - A webpage that displays a user's business details when the QR code is scanned.
